To quickly check if a program is installed on Linux, you can use the command "dpkg -s" followed 
by the unique package name for that program. The "-s" flag in dpkg stands for 
"search," which allows you to search for a program on your machine and check if it's installed. 

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -f #force an update of the package manager, using this command
sudo apt-get install firefox-esr

apt does have some similar command options as apt-get, it’s not backward compatible with apt-get.
That means it won’t always work if you just replace the apt-get part of an apt-get command with apt.
