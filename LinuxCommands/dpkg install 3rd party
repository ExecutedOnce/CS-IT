DPKG INSTALL
First, use dpkg to install a text editor, called Atom. A .deb file is located at "/home/qwiklab/downloads/atom-amd64.deb", which you can install using this command:

sudo dpkg -i /home/qwiklab/downloads/atom-amd64.deb

You can remedy this by using apt to fix the missing dependencies, using this command:

sudo apt install -f


EXTRACT/ARCHIVE
Next, you will extract a .tar archive. The archive "extract_me.tar" is located in "/home/qwiklab/downloads/". Move to that directory, using this command:

cd /home/qwiklab/downloads
Copied!
You can use the Linux tar command to extract it using this command:

sudo tar -xvf extract_me.tar


ARCHIVING FILES
You can also use the tar command to do the reverse operation, creating an archive. There are three files in your /home/qwiklab/documents folder named "Earth", "Mercury", and "Venus". Use tar to archive them into the file "Planets.tar" using this command (one line):

tar -cvf Planets.tar --absolute-names /home/qwiklab/documents/Earth /home/qwiklab/documents/Mercury /home/qwiklab/documents/Venus



INSTALLING FILES
You can also install programs on Linux, using apt too, which handles dependencies for you to simplify the installation process. You can install the program 7-Zip, using apt, with a simple one-line command:

sudo apt install p7zip-full

REMOVING
sudo apt remove gimp
dpkg -s gimp
