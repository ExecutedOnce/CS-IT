The ps -aux command allows you to list all currently running processes on a Linux machine. However, the list of processes is often super long, which makes finding a specific process pretty tough. To filter the processes you're interested in, you can pipe the output of ps through grep.
ps -aux | grep "totally_not_malicious"
sudo kill [PiD]

terminate multiple
ps -aux | grep "razzle"

sudo kill [pid]
pkill -f "name"
